Nature grounds you. It took me an entire afternoon at the Sunshine Cafe to retrospect the previous days. A poem to quickly capture the feelings, emotions, and the journey as I experienced it.

<br>We wanted to see snow
<br>but little did we know
<br>we had to trek up high
<br>unlike the ravens who could fly

<br>Panting through every stride
<br>until our legs cried
<br>we reached our camp atop
<br>a hill, made our stop

<br>With us worn out from the day
<br>it was the perfect place to stay
<br>Dusk was here and snow so near
<br>We had food and music to hear

<br>Some ate, drank, and danced
<br>while we heated up our pants
<br>around the campfire, where we sat
<br>we also had a nice chat

<br>Dawn was here, and snow so near
<br>we started uphill with a little fear
<br>as rains may make it harder
<br>for us to venture farther

<br>We walked over many bridges
<br>even ones which were just ridges
<br>Water, mud, snow, and gravel
<br>can summarize the entire travel

<br>Forward we went, with our poncho
<br>making sure our doubts don't show
<br>And then came the first patch of snow
<br>making it all the more exciting now

<br>As i take another coffee sip
<br>and think about the trip
<br>I'm glad we're safe and back
<br>with nothing but a muddy track *(pant)*
