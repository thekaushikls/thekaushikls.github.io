*I graduated in 2019 with a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science and Engineering from SRM University, India. I'm primarily a Full stack Developer but I'm flexible enough to work across teams and pick up any new technologies and languages. I see myself as a problem solver and I'm looking to rapidly advance my skills as a well rounded software engineer. I have a fairly good Functional Programming background, learning and working in languages like Scala, Haskell, Elm and Rust, as well as coaching myself on Type Theory from time to time. Also I'm a big Javascript Geek having survived through the infamous JS Fatigue.*

# **My experience at Indix**
After having interned at two other companies during the Summer, I was hired by Indix at my University's Campus Recruitment. I was asked to write a blog post about my whole experience. [Here it is](http://tofsis.com/placements-2014-indix-technologies/).

After the new hire bootcamp, I opted to work for the Engineering Tools Team. I started out with adding features, bug fixes and writing Python scripts for the Customer Success Team. It wasn't long before I got to work on new projects.

Despite my lack of professional experience when I first started out, my Team Lead trusted me enough in letting me own and work end-to-end on the development (Balsamiq Mockups to Design/Architecture to Deployment)  of a complex non-trivial project and taking it to Production.

The project involved developing a web-based tool that would be used to outsource the data ingestion workflow activities for automated focused crawling by means of tagging the website through mouse actions, similar to [ParseHub](https://www.parsehub.com/) but covering Indix's Platform specific usecases. The web application was written in React/Redux, RxJS. The core part of the application was written in Scala and a Play Service wrapper around it.

During my time there, I also wrote an open source node library that has been downloaded over [5000 times](https://npm-stat.com/charts.html?package=web-auto-extractor#pkgs) on NPM. https://github.com/ind9/web-auto-extractor

# **What I’m looking to do next**
I've just moved to NYC this month (August). I'm primarily a Full Stack Developer but I'm flexible enough to work across teams and pick up any new technologies and languages. Looking for an opportunity where I can improve and advance my career and skills as a [T shaped](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T-shaped_skills) Developer, getting a chance to work on a broad range of technologies from Mobile to Graphics to Data. I also deeply value Company Culture.

# **Projects**

### Side Projects
**elm-chessboard** - [Website](http://addnab.com/elm-chessboard) | [Source](https://github.com/addnab/elm-chessboard)

I'm currently working on a 1v1 Chessboard Implementation written in [elm-lang](http://elm-lang.org/). All possible piece moves have been implemented. Further looking to expand with features such as drag and drop pieces and chess record notation.

### Open Source Projects
**web-auto-extractor** - [Source](https://github.com/ind9/web-auto-extractor)

An Open-Source Node Project I worked on during my work at Indix that has been downloaded over [5000 times](https://npm-stat.com/charts.html?package=web-auto-extractor#pkgs) on NPM. It is used to extract semantically structured information (primarily Schema.org) from webpages.
