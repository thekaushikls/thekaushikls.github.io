Have you saved a file[^1] to your computer (or phone)? Have you searched endlessly through your email inbox / chat history to find that one file?

## Introduction
We work with digital files everyday at various instances.

1. **We create new files** when we capture a photo,
2. **We share files** to friends, family, colleagues, etc.
3. **We save files** that other people share with us.

## What's in a Name?
Can you tell which files of the files below are important, and which can be deleted safely?

<div class="grid cards" markdown>
   - <span style="color: blue;">:material-file-document: **`final.doc`**</span>
   - <span style="color: red;">:fontawesome-regular-file-pdf: **`new.pdf`**</span>
   - <span style="color: orange;">:fontawesome-solid-photo-film: **`download.jpeg`**</span>
   - <span style="color: green;">:material-file-excel: **`latest.xls`**</span>
</div>

It could be photos, documents, financial statements, health reports, or any other information that we need. But, **we store files with random or cryptic names**, making it impossible to guess what they contain. 

<center><h3> *"We save files, because we want to find them later."* </h3></center><br>

We do not need the files themselves. We only need the information inside the file(s). If we need them quickly, **we need to be able to identify them quickly.**

<br><center><h3><i> "The File Name is a clue to understand it's contents, without opening them." </i></h3></center><br>

## Some Good Examples

<div class="grid cards" markdown>
   - <span style="color: blue;">:material-file-document: **`organic-chemistry-notes.doc`**</span>
   - <span style="color: red;">:fontawesome-regular-file-pdf: **`2024.12.10-internet-receipt.pdf`**</span>
   - <span style="color: orange;">:fontawesome-solid-photo-film: **`kaushik-passport-photo.jpeg`**</span>
   - <span style="color: green;">:material-file-excel: **`FY23-24-account-statement.xls`**</span>
</div>

Isn't it easier to understand the files now?
Next time I need to get my passport photo printed, I know exactly which file to share.
