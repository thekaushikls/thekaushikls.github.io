DAWN WAS HERE, AND SNOW SO NEAR
<!-- more -->
# Kheerganga

<center>
We wanted to see snow
<br>but little did we know
<br>we had to trek up high
<br>unlike the ravens who could fly

<br>Panting through every stride
<br>until our legs cried
<br>we reached our camp atop
<br>a hill, made our stop

<br>With us worn out from the day
<br>it was the perfect place to stay
<br>Dusk was here and snow so near
<br>We had food and music to hear

<br>Some ate, drank, and danced
<br>while we heated up our pants
<br>around the campfire, where we sat
<br>we also had a nice chat

<br>Dawn was here and snow so near
<br>we started uphill with a little fear
<br>as rains may make it harder
<br>for us to venture farther

<br>We walked over many bridges
<br>even ones which were just ridges
<br>Water, mud, snow, and gravel
<br>can summarize the entire travel

<br>Forward we went, with our poncho
<br>making sure our doubts don't show
<br>And then came the first patch of snow
<br>making it all the more exciting now

<br>As i take another coffee sip
<br>and think about the trip
<br>I'm glad we're safe and back
<br>with nothing but a muddy track *(pant)*

> We were the flatlanders pushed to our limits, moving slowly and cautiously in 6" snow. Some were faster, some slower. In the end, we were in the middle. Alone but surrounded at a distance.

> Occassionaly we'd see some experienced locals bolting across us as if we were standing still. But it were the fools who tried to copy them that scared me the most. I once reflexively caught a fellow trekker just as he was about to slide off a cliff. He jokingly thanked me for saving him.
