Have you ever heard grandparents say, "Back in the day, things did not cost this much"? I remember buying 2 candies for ₹1 as a kid. Today, a single candy costs ₹2. I only understood *inflation* in theory. Now, twenty years later, I've felt it myself.

As kids, we're constantly reminded to save money whenever we can. Spare change, birthday money from grandparents, remaining lunch money -- all go under the mattress, in my case, an old tin with a slotted lid. I might've saved around ₹5,000 before I had my first bank account. It was worth 10,000 candies. Today, the same ₹5,000 is worth only 1,250 candies. The rest? Eaten away by inflation.

One way of looking at it is that *Goods are becoming expensive*. But a box of candies then, and a box of candies now bring the same amount of happiness (and diabetes), not much has changed. Another perspective to consider is that *Money loses its purchasing power over time*.

So, the spare cash under your mattress, or secretly hidden inside the rice sack, is losing its value.
