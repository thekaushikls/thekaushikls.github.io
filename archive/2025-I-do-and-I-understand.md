# I Do and I Understand
Agenda 21. That was one of the important topics discussed in Sustainable Architecture classes during my bachelors. We also read about **Timber** &mdash; it's manufacturing processes such as felling, drying, and seasoning. It's a bit of a surprise that now I can recollect only bits and pieces of information, mostly diagrams from the textbook, none of the classroom lectures.

Last weekend, I had the opportunity to recollect them. Theoretical knowledge of Wood types, Cutting, and Joinery details were finally put to use when I had to select the right material for my carpentry project with [Studio-Clutter](Studio-Clutter).

But not all was old knowledge being recollected. I learnt something new and interesting.
## [Hardwood](Hardwood)s and [Softwood](Softwood)s

> Deciduous trees produce hardwoods. Evergreen trees produce softwoods.

When trees grow, they form new layers of bark (skin) forming the **Annual Rings** that are visible in a cross-sectional cut. The annual rings allows is to estimate the age of a tree since a new ring is formed (grown) every year.

Deciduous trees hand shed leaves in bloom in the spring, bear fruit in summer, shed leaves in autumn, and go into power-saving mode during the cold winters. Each new ring / layer of bark is exposed to various elements (temperature, humidity, etc.) making it more resilient. As a result, timber produced from these trees are more dense and is called [Hardwood](Hardwood).

Evergreen trees grow all around the year i.e. the rings grow continuously over the entire year. **Comparatively**, timber from evergreen trees are less dense, forming [Softwood](Softwood)


I went with 5.5" x 1" [Pinewood](Pinewood) planks for my project.
